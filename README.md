# dijkstra-algorithm
Python 3 implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm

This is a simple implementation that returns the shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph, with a focus on clarity and simplicity rather than robustness or performance.

It only uses the Python standard library, and should work with any Python 3.x version. I've tested it with Python 3.4 and Python 3.7.

The graphs used for testing are stored in text files, which define one edge on each line. See the source code for details.

Note that the seattle_area.txt file defines each edge twice, in both directions, essentially making it an undirected graph.
